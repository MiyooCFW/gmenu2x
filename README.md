View changelog in [changelog](https://github.com/MiyooCFW/gmenu2x/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) file & [release](https://github.com/MiyooCFW/gmenu2x/releases) page.

## Installation

#### A) Binary
1. Replace the ``gmenu2x`` binary with the latest one.

2. Restart GMenu2X frontend or reboot device.

## Building

### MiyooCFW:

Set up your environment with latest SDK (use [MiyooCFW/buildroot](https://github.com/miyoocfw/buildroot/)). Generated toolchain should be placed at `/opt/miyoo/` directory.
- build gmenu2x binary:
```
make -f Makefile.miyoo
```
- build GMenu2X distribution package:
```
make -f Makefile.miyoo dist
```
you can find both outputs in `./dist/miyoo/` directory.
### PC (Linux):
This is primarily useful for development/testing. 
First, install the dependencies. This should work for Debian/Ubuntu systems, use the appropriate package manager for other systems:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libboost-all-dev libfreetype6-dev libbz2-dev libmpg123-dev
```
Compile with:
```sh
make dist
```
Then run it from the `dist/linux/` directory:
```sh
cd dist/linux
./gmenu2x
```

## Translations

The list of available translations with examples are stored in `gmenu2x/translations/` dir of your GMenu2X distribution package.  
The current in use messages from U.S. English language can be read from: [translate.txt](https://github.com/MiyooCFW/gmenu2x/blob/master/translate.txt). This does not include appLinks' Title&Description which can be added freely by user.

You can run `tools/gen_translate.sh` to generate above list providing argument in form of txt file with list of #define for your platform. Otherwise you can rebuild GMenu2X with `-DCHECK_TRANSLATION` CFLAG in Makefile. Then after running binary with selected language you will find `untraslated.txt`file with list of missing translation strings which failed to be generated at the time of using GMenu2X.

The "\_about\_" string (in translation file) assigns corresponding text file for displaying _About_ message, e.g. "\_about\_=\_about\_en" means _about_en.txt is being used for English translation.

### Dictionary
To view the full list of string messages available to translate in source see: [dictionary.txt](https://github.com/MiyooCFW/gmenu2x/blob/master/dictionary.txt)

To generate this list of available strings' aliases you can run from src:  
```
(grep -o -rn . -P -e "\ttr\["[^]]*"\]" ; grep -o -rn . -e '>tr\["[^]]*"\]\|(tr\["[^]]*"\]\|\+tr\["[^]]*"\]\|\ tr\["[^]]*"\]\|,tr\["[^]]*"\]') | sed 's/.*\[\(.*\)\].*/\1/' | sed 's/\"\(.*\)\"/\1=/' | tr -d '\\' | sort | uniq
```
